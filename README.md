Group Members: William Duggleby, Brendon Lugo

Project Scope: Text based adventure game
User will select a character type from a menu of options. Menu will display a character image.
Once the character is chosen, the player will go through several “turns” where they choose which direction they go.
Different directions allow for different opportunities. Finding items, encountering enemies, and gaining.
Items can include weapon and armor upgrades.
Enemies may be easy or difficult. Defeating an enemy gives the player bonuses in stats.

Classes: Character class: (knight, archer, mage, priest archetypes)
	       Enemy class: (Dragon, zombie, wolf)
         End credits
	       UI
	   
Objects: 	Weapons
	       Gear
	       Food

Boundaries:
Player will be presented with a text based description of different paths to take.

ie. “To the north you see a forest with a mountain beyond. To the East you see a the mountain appear closer, but you can hear wolves nearby. To the west you sense a darkness, but also an opportunity for fortune.”

There will be a max number of turns before the player encounters a final boss.
There will be no limit to health. If food is found it will add with no cap.
Damage may be calculated by taking preset damage values for weapons and armor and creating a range of damage that may hit. Boss types will hit hard, but less often than a character can.
Only one weapon may be held at a time.
Different armor options will be available for each class.
Different weapon options will be available for each class.

ie. Knights get swords, shields, and broadswords. Mages get spells and robes. Priests get spells and robes. Archers get leather armor and bows. (Arrows will be default and unlimited)
